RITA SALT

App Title: RITA SALT - Tattoo Design Showcase and Appointment Management

Description
Here I have created a Tatoo booking  web application tailored for my dear friend and  Tatoo artist Rita Salt. It provides a platform to explore various tattoo designs, commonly referred to as 'flashes', and manage tattoo appointments. This application integrates a sleek, user-friendly interface with functionalities that cater to both client and artist.
